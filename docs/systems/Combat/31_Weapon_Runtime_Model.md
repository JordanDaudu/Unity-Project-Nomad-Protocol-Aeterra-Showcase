## 🧭 Overview
`Weapon` is a pure C# runtime model (not a MonoBehaviour). It represents one weapon instance in the player’s inventory and owns:
- Current ammo counts
- Fire timing (`lastFireTime`)
- Spread accumulation and cooldown
- Burst mode config + toggle logic

## 🎯 Purpose
Keep weapon rules and state separate from:
- Input handling (`PlayerWeaponController`)
- Visuals/animations (`PlayerWeaponVisuals`)
- Data assets (`WeaponData`)

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- `WeaponData` defines defaults; `Weapon` holds runtime state.
- Encapsulate “can we shoot/reload?” checks inside the weapon model.
- Keep controller code focused on orchestration, not math.

Trade-off: `Weapon` currently mixes multiple concerns (spread + burst + ammo) in one class for simplicity.

## 📦 Core Responsibilities
**Does**
- Initialize from `WeaponData` via constructor.
- Implement spread:
  - `ApplySpread(Vector3)`
- Implement burst mode:
  - `IsBurstModeActive()`
  - `ToggleBurstMode()`
- Implement shooting checks:
  - `CanShoot()` (ammo + fire-rate gate)
- Implement reload logic:
  - `CanReload()`
  - `RefillBullets()`

**Does NOT**
- Spawn bullets or play animations.
- Know anything about the player, input, or camera.

## 🧱 Key Components
Classes / Enums
- `Weapon` (`Scripts/Weapon/Weapon.cs`)
- `WeaponType` enum
- `ShootType` enum

Data relationship
- Holds reference to the source `weaponData` (for pickup drop reconstruction).

## 🔄 Execution Flow
1. Created via `new Weapon(weaponData)`
2. Firing cycle:
   - Controller calls `CanShoot()`
   - If true → controller decrements `bulletsInMagazine` and spawns bullet
3. Spread:
   - Controller calls `ApplySpread(direction)` when firing
4. Reload:
   - Controller checks `CanReload()`, plays reload animation
   - Animation event calls `RefillBullets()`

## 🔗 Dependencies
**Depends On**
- Unity `Time.time` for fire-rate timing and spread cooldown.
- `WeaponData` for initialization.

**Used By**
- `PlayerWeaponController` (shoot/reload/toggle burst)
- `PickupWeapon` (stores/uses a `Weapon` instance)

## ⚠ Constraints & Assumptions
- `ReadyToFire()` updates `lastFireTime` when it returns true (the timing gate mutates state).
- Shotgun special-case: `IsBurstModeActive()` forces burst behavior and sets `burstFireDelay = 0`.
- Spread uses “random Euler” around all axes (same random value for x/y/z), which may not match final intended recoil feel.

## 📈 Scalability & Extensibility
- Add per-weapon “projectile pattern” logic (e.g., shotgun pellet cone) here if you keep it purely math/state.
- If complexity grows, split into sub-models (AmmoModel, SpreadModel, FireModeModel) later.
